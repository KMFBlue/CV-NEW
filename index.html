      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I started as a food technologist in Brewery Zagreb, continued in other companies, 
	finally ended in Ministry of Health. Had to try life in Ireland, came back and got
        the best job so far in my life. I ❤️ coffee & beer.</p>

        <p>#1 Taxi Driver in <a target="_blank" href="https://radiotaxizagreb.com/hr/">Radio Taxi Zagreb</a>
          and the whole of the Zagreb. I work mainly through the dispatch center, but I also have private arrangements,
          both scheduled and upon notice. I'm fluent in English language and it enables me to work with foreigners.
          As much as I love this job and enjoy working it, I'm also looking to expand personally and profesionally
          and therefore I'm studying to become a programmer.

        <p>I started "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" course in last week of April.
          I'm very motivated to go through the course and finish all challenges with full understandig of the matter.
          I'm looking forward to adopt a new set of Skills and start working as soon as possible. Listening to lessons taught by Angela Yu
          is very interesting and requires full attention from the listener.</p>
